title: "Books about LA Tech"
---

When I first moved to LA in 2015, it was for all the typical reasons:
the weather, the beach, and one not so typical -- the chance to become a Lakers season ticket holder (~3000 on the waiting list!).

After visiting the city, attending a few tech events, and researching on Glassdoor, I knew that there was enough of a tech "scene"
that I'd be able to find a job.  Sites like [Built in LA](https://builtinla.com), really helped to highlight the startups and job openings.

While websites and blogs are great for quick takes, I enjoy getting in depth.  Plus I like reading before going to bed ‚ò∫Ô∏è.
So here are some worthwhile books about LA tech.

[Chronicle of a Startup Town: Los Angeles](https://amzn.to/2HCdVvL)

This is the first book you should read.  It a few years old now, but gives a great introduction onto the history of LA tech.

[Stealing MySpace: The Battle to Control the Most Popular Website in America](https://amzn.to/343aZjk)

A great book that provides insight into:
- how unregulated the internet was in the early 2000s
- the technical issues that plagued early social networks
- how companies in LA that were "tech" still tried to be "media" companies

[How to Turn Down a Billion Dollars: The Snapchat Story](https://amzn.to/346JgOv)

The first half describes Evan Spiegel's time at Stanford and the founding of Snapchat.  Great insight and goes in depth into the Reggie Brown issue.
The second half is worth skimming since most of it is describing feature additions to the Snapchat app.
Facebook's failed attempts at purchasing, then copying Snapchat are highlighted in an entertainingly negative way.

[The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company](https://amzn.to/2HwG6Mp)

Not really related to LA tech, but a great book overall.  It starts out pretty slow, but really picks up when Bob Iger becomes CEO.
The retelling of the acquisitions of Marvel and Pixar, emphasize building and repairing trust.  Has some hilarious anecdotes about Steve Jobs.

I'm starting to read: [Powerhouse: The Untold Story of Hollywood's Creative Artists Agency](https://amzn.to/348hyB2)
I'm fascinated by the inner workings of show business the below-the-line, behind the scenes details.
I'll probably create a separate post about entertainment industry books I've read.

But for now, don't forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell. ü§ô
