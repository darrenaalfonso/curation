title: "Books about LA Tech"
---

When I first moved to LA in 2015, it was for all the typical reasons:
the weather, the beach, and one not so typical -- the chance to become a Lakers season ticket holder (~3000 on the waiting list!).

After visiting the city, attending a few tech events, and researching on Glassdoor, I knew that there was enough of a tech "scene"
that I'd be able to find a job.  Sites like [Built in LA](https://builtinla.com), really helped to highlight the startups and job openings.

While websites and blogs are great for quick takes, I enjoy getting in depth.  Plus I like reading before going to bed ☺️.
So here are some worthwhile books about LA tech.
