title: "Hello world / About this blog"

Hello world.  My name is Darren.

The last time I had a blog was in 2005 or 2006 when I just started my first internship.  I wanted to be an investment banker or accountant when I grew up.
The blog was called "New Collar Worker", pretty catchy title 😜.  Good job past me.

I don't really remember the _raison d'être_ for the blog.  IIRC, I had one post about the stock market and fantasy football?

I never did become an investment banker or accountant.  Now I'm a software engineer living in LA.  So of course I'll be musing on software engineering, tech, and the Los Angeles area.

The tech industry in LA exists (Snap, SpaceX, and [others](https://www.builtinla.com/companies?status=all) are HQ'd here), but it's in the background to "the industry" AKA show business.  And I _like_ that.
The diversity of industries in the LA area brings an ever-present novelty to meetups and gatherings.

A few years ago I had a desk at the Manhattan Beach WeWork.
My "coworkers" were film makers, lawyers, real estate agents, salespeople, marketers.  I was the only software engineer.
Hearing different challenges and issues from other industries, getting different opinions on ideas just makes for a fresher conversation than 
hearing about fundraising or growth hacking.

However, the tech industry is continuing to grow in LA.  The phrase "Silicon Beach" (which I hate) is getting used a lot more.

As the 2020's roll on, you'll get my thoughts right here, every `{insert time period of how often I expect to blog, but will actually be half as frequent}`.

Here's to the journey 🍻
