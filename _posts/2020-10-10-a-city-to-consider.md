title: "A City to Consider"
---

During the pandemic, [people are moving](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/08/921769579/wheres-everyone-moving-to).
People are [leaving LA](https://dot.la/los-angeles-tech-2647885395.html), but I want to focus on [people moving to LA](https://dot.la/moving-to-los-angeles-2647875905.html).

> But for those coming from New York or San Francisco who are wealthy enough to afford million dollar-plus mortgages, L.A. still offers a relative bargain. According to Zillow, the median home value in San Francisco is $1,447,191 and the median rental price in San Francisco is $4,500 compared to $752,508 for homes in Los Angeles and $3,500 for rentals.

Before coming to LA, I lived in New York.
I spent a year there and learned a lot -- how to enjoy walking, the subway lines, what scooped bagels are, how to enjoy walking, but most importantly, how to live in smaller space.

But after a while, my small studio just wasn't enough.  I couldn't have a proper dining room or living room.
For the price of my studio in New York, I could have a one-bedroom near the beach in LA.  I can totally understand the migration.

BUT, New Yorkers and San Franciscans with the freedom to permanently work remotely need to consider another city: **San Diego.**

Outside of the obvious benefits (weather, beaches, proximity to amusement parks, a major airport, etc.), San Diego tech scene is ascending.

> San Diego is becoming an appealing city for tech companies and workers due to its lower cost of living.

San Diego is [one of six emerging tech cities](https://www.cio.com/article/3570227/6-hot-emerging-tech-hubs-for-it-job-seekers.html) according to cio.com.

Startup Genome ranked [San Diego 21st in its Global Startup Ecosystem Ranking](https://startupgenome.com/reports/gser2020),
while not as high as Silicon Valley (#1) or Los Angeles (#6), it shows that San Diego is gaining a global reputation as a startup city.  CompTIA ranked [San Diego #17 in its 2019 Tech Town Index](https://comptiacdn.azureedge.net/webcontent/docs/default-source/research-reports/2019-us-tech-town-report-online-835393612.pdf?sfvrsn=1ac437d1_0), while Los Angeles wasn't even ranked.

From an affordability standpoint, [San Diego beats LA for first-time homebuyer affordability](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/fthb-affordability-q22020).

Downtown San Diego offers much better nightlife and walkability than Los Angeles, arguably because [more of the population works downtown](http://www.city-data.com/forum/city-vs-city/1169226-more-urban-downtown-los-angeles-san.html), (data almost a decade old and the source is someone on the internet, so take it with a grain of salt).

So why haven't I moved to San Diego?  Well, I'm actually looking forward to going back into the office.  I miss the collaboration, the chats, the lunches, and all the bonding that comes from being in the same physical space.
My current job had a great office in Santa Monica near 3rd Street Promenade and I hope we can go back soon.  

BUT if I'm forced to work from home, I will definitely consider it.  ðŸ¤™
