title: "LA's Tech Anchor"
---

Most people are familiar with [anchor stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_tenant) within a shopping center.
According to wikipedia, "They are intended to attract a significant cross-section of the shopping public to the center". 
Macy's, Nordstrom, Bloomingdales...they get people into the mall and while you're there, you go to the boutiques and small shops.

What about [tent-pole movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent-pole_(entertainment))?  
> "A tentpole movie, for example, is a film that is expected to support a wide range of ancillary tie-in products such as toys and games"

When it comes to tech, anchor companies solidify the city/region's tech and startup and become a foundation for future growth.
Buoyed by strong investment, competitive salaries, IPOs, and liquidation events, anchor companies and their employee diaspora go on to create angel funds, VC/PE firms, and startups
This virtuous cycle creates a prosperous ecosystem.

There are anchor companies that are undeniable.  Facebook, Apple, and Google anchor Silicon Valley.  Amazon and Microsoft anchor Seattle.
There are others on the fringes -- is Netflix an anchor company?  Is Uber?  What makes an anchor company an anchor company?

To answer this question, I sought to find the common characteristics between the "undeniable" anchors I previously mentioned.
Through the course of this exercise, I found that some traits don't really mean much e.g. founding date.
Facebook was founded in 2004, while Microsoft and Apple were founded in 1975 and 1976, respectively.  Google was founded in 1998.

Similarly, founders as the CEO.  Google, Apple, and Microsoft have each had multiple CEOs, while Amazon and Facebook have only had one (their founder).

After filtering out the list, here are my "requirements to be an anchor" (This list is not scientific.  I tried to be as objective as possible, but let's face it, this is still subjective and still just my opinion.):

<h4>1. Be headquartered in the city you anchor.</h4>  Even though Google has an office in Seattle [right across from Amazon](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/first-look-inside-google-clouds-new-seattle-campus-right-across-street-amazon/#:~:text=Google%20Cloud%20on%20Thursday%20officially,%2C%20Android%2C%20Maps%20and%20Chrome.),
but that doesn't mean Google anchors Seattle.  Sidenote, one of my pet peeves are proponents of a city saying "Google is here, Apple is here" just because those companies have satellite ofices in the city.

<h4>2. Be public.</h4>  Public companies make headlines.  They signal to startup founders, "If {anchor company} was able to thrive in our city, you can too."  
To a lesser extent, public companies grant RSUs that often attract more tech talent to the company and, ipso facto, the region.

<h4>3. Be in the Fortune 500.</h4>  If the company doesn't make enough revenue, it can't grow.

<h4>4. Have A LOT of employees.</h4>  At least 10,000.  The more employees you have, the more "tech" becomes part of your city.  The more employees you have, the more likely one of them starts a company in the same city.

<h4>5. Be a software company.</h4>  This is the most subjective requirement.  While some believe ["every company is a tech company"](https://www.wsj.com/articles/every-company-is-now-a-tech-company-1543901207)
that doesn't mean every company is a **software** company.  Why does being a software company matter?  It doesn't really, but this is my list üòè




But Disney is an anchor company of LA, no doubt.  But it's not a tech anchor because it's primary business is entertainment.
